# React Portfolio

An updated version of my full-stack portfolio that implements React, a cutting-edge JavaScript library.

## Description

This website utilizes React to dynamically display information about myself and projects that I have recently built. Visitors can view six projects that I have created, and can filter them based on the type of project it is (front-end, back-end, and full-stack). The website also includes my contact information and a link to a PDF of my resume.

It was an interesting opportunity to take code that I previously created and refactor it to work with React. I gained a much better understanding of how to conceptually split a website/web application into several components. I also refactored the project section so that, rather than hard-coding each project in the projects section, unique information is imported for each project from a JSON file, ultimately making the portfolio more scalable. I also learned more about the .filter() and .map() functions in JavaScript, as well as conditional rendering in React.

Overall, creating this new portfolio was a great experience and I became more comfortable with React by creating it. I look forward to the projects that I will create with React in the future.

A few ideas for future development include:

- Splitting the app into more components that are smaller and serve only one purpose
- Changing the color of the active button on the projects page
